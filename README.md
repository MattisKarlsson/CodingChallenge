URLShortener: 
JS Native.

First I wanted to try and use a decryption DB to generate the URLs and store them, though it ended being a little too complicated and undocumented so went back and used MongoDB for it's simplicity and well documentation.

Stumbled upon some issues with the URLValidation at first just general setup with MongoDB, though that wasnt too much of a challenge to solve.
